1.  We shall overcome  
We shall overcome  
We shall overcome some day  


- Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe  
We shall overcome some day  


2. We'll walk hand in hand  
We'll walk hand in hand  
We'll walk hand in hand some day  


3. We shall all be free  
We shall all be free  
We shall all be free some day  


4. We are not afraid  
We are not afraid  
We are not afraid some day  


5. We are not afraid  
We are not afraid  
We are not afraid some day  


6. The whole wide world around  
The whole wide world around  
The whole wide world around some day  


7. We shall overcome  
We shall overcome  
We shall overcome some day
