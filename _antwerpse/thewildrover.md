1. I've been a wild rover for many's a year  
And I spent all my money on whiskey and beer,  
And now I'm returning with gold in great store  
And I never will play the wild rover no more.  


- And it's no, nay, never,  
No nay never no more,  
Will I play the wild rover  
No never no more.  


2. I went to an ale-house I used to frequent  
And I told the landlady my money was spent.  
I asked her for credit, she answered me nay  
Such a custom as yours I could have any day.  


3. I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright  
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.  
She said I have whiskey and wines of the best  
And the words that I spoke sure were only in jest.  


4. I'll have none of your whiskeys nor fine Spanish wine,  
For your words show you clearly as no friend of mine.  
There's others most willing to open a door,  
To a man coming home from a far distant shore.  


5. I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done  
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.  
And if they caress (forgive) me as ofttimes before  
Sure I never will play the wild rover no more.
