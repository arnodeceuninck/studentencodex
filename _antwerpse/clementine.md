{:start="1"}  
1.  1. In a cavern, in a canyon,  
Excavating for a mine  
Dwelt a miner forty niner,  
And his daughter Clementine.  


Refrain  
Oh my darling, oh my darling,  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
You were lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.  


{:start="2"}  
2. Light she was and like a fairy,  
And her shoes were number nine,  
Herring boxes, without topses,  
Sandals were for Clementine.  


{:start="3"}  
3. Drove she ducklings to the water  
Ev'ry morning just at nine,  
Stubbed her toe against a splinter,  
Fell into the foaming brine.  


{:start="4"}  
4. Ruby lips above the water,  
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine,  
But, alas, I was no swimmer,  
So I lost my Clementine.  


{:start="5"}  
5. In a churchyard on a hillside,  
Where the flowers grow and twine,  
There grow roses amongst the posies  
Fertilised by Clementine.  


{:start="6"}  
6. Then the miner, forty-niner,  
Soon began to peak and pine,  
Thought he oughter join his daughter,  
Now he's with his Clementine.  


{:start="7"}  
7. In my dreams she still doth haunt me,  
Robed in garments soaked in brine;  
How in life I used to hug her,  
Now she's dead, I draw the line.  


{:start="8"}  
8. How I missed her! How I missed her,  
How I missed my Clementine,  
But I kissed her little sister,  
I forgot my Clementine.
