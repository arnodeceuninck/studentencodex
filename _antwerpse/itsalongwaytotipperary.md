1.  Up to mighty London came  
An Irish lad one day,  
All the streets were paved with gold,  
So everyone was gay!  
Singing songs of Piccadilly,  
Strand, and Leicester Square,  
Til Paddy got excited and  
He shouted to them there:  


- It's a long way to Tipperary,  
It's a long way to go.  
It's a long way to Tipperary  
To the sweetest girl I know!  
Goodbye Piccadilly,  
Farewell Leicester Square!  
It's a long long way to Tipperary,  
But my heart's right there.

2. Paddy wrote a letter  
To his Irish Molly O',  
Saying, "Should you not receive it,  
Write and let me know!  
If I make mistakes in "spelling",  
Molly dear", said he,  
"Remember it's the pen, that's bad,  
Don't lay the blame on me".

3. Molly wrote a neat reply  
To Irish Paddy O',  
Saying, "Mike Maloney wants  
To marry me, and so  
Leave the Strand and Piccadilly,  
Or you'll be to blame,  
For love has fairly drove me silly,  
Hoping you're the same!"
