{:start="1"}  
1. I've been on Erasmus for almost a year  
I've spend all my money on party and beer  
French kissing and pimping are games for the best  
Erasmus Orgasmus is not for the rest  


- And it's no, nay, never  
Sex on the floor!  
No, nay, never, no more  
Erasmus Orgasmus  
No, never, no more

2. Caf√© De Prof is the place to be  
We usually think that the beer is for free  
We told the bartender our money was spend  
But drunken Wimmeke did not understand

3. I went home to my parets, confessed what I've done  
My eternal hangover is finally gone  
Stella and Duvel are beers of our kind  
When we drink them together, they fuck up our mind!
