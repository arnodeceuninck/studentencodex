1.  Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar one evening fair  
And one could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share  
He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet  
Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street  
Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  
He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street

2. About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by  
And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye  
See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built  
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt  
Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt

3. They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be  
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see  
And there behold, for them to view, beneath his Scottish skirt  
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth  
Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth

4. They marveled for a moment, then one said we must be gone  
Let's leave a present for our friend, before we move along  
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow  
Around the bonnie star, the Scot's kilt did lift and show  
Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  
Around the bonnie star, the Scots kilt did lift and show

5. Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled toward the trees  
Behind a bush, he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees  
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes.  
O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize  
Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  
O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize
