1. I look'd over Jordan, and what did I see,  
Coming for to carry me home!  
A band of angels coming after me,  
Coming for to carry me home!

Coming for to carry me home,  
Swing low, sweet chariot,  
Coming for to carry me home,

2. If you get there before I do,  
Coming for to carry me home!  
Tell all my friends I'm coming too,  
Coming for to carry me home!

3. The brightest day that ever I saw,  
When Jesus washed my sins away.

4. I'm sometimes up and sometimes down,  
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.
