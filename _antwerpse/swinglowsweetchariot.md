1. I look'd over Jordan, and what did I see,  
Coming for to carry me home!  
A band of angels coming after me,  
Coming for to carry me home!  


- Swing low, sweet chariot,  
Coming for to carry me home,  
Swing low, sweet chariot,  
Coming for to carry me home,  


2. If you get there before I do,  
Coming for to carry me home!  
Tell all my friends I'm coming too,  
Coming for to carry me home!  


3. The brightest day that ever I saw,  
When Jesus washed my sins away.  


4. I'm sometimes up and sometimes down,  
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.
