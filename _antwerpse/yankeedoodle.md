1.  Yankee Doodle went to town  
A-riding on a pony,  
Stuck a feather in his cap  
And called it macaroni.  


- Yankee Doodle keep it up  
Yankee Doodle dandy                  
Mind the music and the step   
and with the girls be handy  


2. Father and I went down to camp   
along with Captain Gooding  
There we saw the men and boys  
as thick as hasty pudding  


3. And there we saw a thousand men   
as rich as Squire David  
And what they wasted everyday  
I wish it could be sa-ved   


4. And capt'n Davis had a gun  
he kinda clapt his hand on't  
And stuck a crooked stabbing iron  
upon the crooked end on't  


5. And there I see a swamming gun  
large as a log of maple  
Upon a mighty little cart  
a load for fatherâ€™s cattle  


6. And every time they fired it off   
it took a horn of powder  
It made a noise like fathers gun   
only a nation louder   


7. I see a little barrel too,  
The heads were made of leather;  
They knocked on it with little clubs  
And called the folks together.  


8. And there was Captainn Washington,  
Upon a slapping stallion  
Giving order to his men  
I guess there was a million  


9. And then the feathers on his hat  
They looked so very fine, ah  
I wanted peskily to get  
To give to my Jemina  


10. I see another snarl of men  
A digging graves they told me  
So 'tarnal long, so 'tarnal deep  
They 'tended they should hold me  


11. It scared me so I hooked it off  
nor stooped as I remember  
Nor turned about till I got home  
locked up in mothers chamber
