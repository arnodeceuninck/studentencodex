1.  It was in the city of London, apprenticed to trade I was bound.
And many the bright amusements, I've had in old London Town.
But a certain misfortune came over me, which caused me to stray from the land.
Far away from my friends and relations, Betrayed by a Black Velvet Band.


- And her eyes they shine like diamonds,
I thought her the pride of the land,
Her hair hung over her shoulder,
Tied up with a black velvet band.


2. As I was walking down Wapping, meaning not long for to stay,
I chanced to see this fair young maid, come a-walkin down Ratcliffe Highway.
Her face it was handsome and comely, her neck it was slim like a swan.
And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a Black Velvet Band.


3. I strolled along with this pretty fair maid, till a gentleman passed us by.
I could see she was meaning to be a-robbing of him, by the look in her dark roving eye.
She nicked a gold watch from his pocket and dropped it clear into my hand.
And the peelers they quickly arrested me, bad luck to the Black Velvet band.


4. So in front of a judge and a jury, next morning I had to appear.
And the beak he looked over the bench at me, said this case is proven quite clear.
So I copped seven years penal servitude, to be spent far away from this land.
Far away from my friends and relations, betrayed by a Black Velvet Band.


5. So come all you jolly apprentice lads, I'll have you take warning by me.
And when you go out on the booze at night, beware of young ladies so free.
They'll lead you to sin and strong drink me lads, till you are not able to stand.
And the very next thing that you know, you may be bound out for Van Dieman's Land.
