_Throughout history, there've been many songs written about the eternal triangle. This next one tells the story of a Mr Grayson, a beautiful woman, and a condemned man named Tom Dooley... When the sun rises tomorrow, Tom Dooley... must hang..._


- Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die


1. I met her on the mountain
There I took her life
Met her on the mountain
Stabbed her with my knife


2. This time tomorrow
Reckon where I'll be
Hadn't a-been for Grayson
I'd a-been in Tennessee


3. This time tomorrow
Reckon where I'll be
Down in some lonesome valley
Hangin' from a white oak tree
