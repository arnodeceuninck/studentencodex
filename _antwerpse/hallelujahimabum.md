1.  Why don't you work like other men do  
How can I work when there's no work to do  


- Hallelujah, I'm a bum  
Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout  
To revive us again  


{:start="2"}  
2. Why don't you save all the money you earn  
If I didn't eat, I'd have money to burn  


{:start="3"}  
3. Whenever I get all the money I earn  
The boss will be broke, and to work he must turn  


{:start="4"}  
4. Oh, I like my boss, he's a good friend of mine  
That's why I am starving out on the bread line  


{:start="5"}  
5. When springtime it comes, oh, won't we have fun  
We'll throw off our jobs, and go on the bum
