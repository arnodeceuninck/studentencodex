1.  John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, (ter)  
His soul goes marching on.  


- Glory, glory, hallelujah,  
Glory, glory, hallelujah,  
His soul goes marching on.

2. He's gone to be a soldier in the Army of the Lord, (ter)  
His soul goes marching on.  


{:start="3"}  
3. John Brown's knapsack is strapped upon his back, (ter)  
His soul goes marching on.  


{:start="4"}  
4. John Brown died that the slaves might be free, (ter)  
His soul goes marching on.  


{:start="5"}  
5. The stars above in Heaven now are looking kindly down, (ter)  
His soul goes marching on.
