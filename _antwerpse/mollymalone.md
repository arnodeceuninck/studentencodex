1. In Dublin's fair city,  
Where girls are so pretty,  
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone,  
As she pushed her wheelbarrow  
Through streets broad and narrow,  
Crying, Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!  


- Alive, alive oh! alive, alive oh!  
Crying, Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!  


2. Now she was a fishmonger,  
And sure twas no wonder,  
For so were her mother and father before,  
And they each wheeled their barrow,  
Through streets broad and narrow,  
Crying, Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!  


3. She died of a fever,  
And no one could save her,  
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.  
Now her ghost wheels her barrow,  
Through streets broad and narrow,  
Crying, Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!
