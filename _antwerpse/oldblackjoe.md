1. Gone are the days  
When my heart was young and gay.  
Gone are my friends  
From the coton fields away.  
Gone from the earth  
To a better land I know.  
I hear their gentle voices  
Calling : Old black Joe  


Chorus  
I’m coming,  
I’m coming  
For my head is bending low.  
I hear their gentle voices  
Calling : Old black Joe  


2. Why do I weep  
When my heart should feel no pain?  
Why do I sigh  
That my friends come not again?  
Grieving for forms  
Now deported long ago?  
I hear their gentle voices  
Calling : Old black Joe  


3. Where are the hearts  
Once so happy and so free?  
Children so dear  
That I held upon my knee?  
Gone to the shore  
Where my soul has longed to go...  
I hear their gentle voices  
Calling : Old black Joe
