Early in the morning.

3. Put him in the long-boat until he's sober...


4. Put him n the scuppers with a hosepipe on him...


5. Pull out the plug and wet him all over...


6. Heave him by the leg in a running bowline...


7. Put him in bed with the captain's daughter...


8. That's what we'll do with the drunken sailor...
