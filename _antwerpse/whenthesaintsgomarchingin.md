1.  We are trav'ling in the footsteps  
Of those who've gone before  
But we'll all be reunited  
On a new and sunlit shore  


- O when the saints go marching in  
When the saints go marching in  
Lord I want to be in that number  
When the saints go marching in

2. And when the sun refuse to shine  
And when the sun refuseto shine  
Lord I want to be in that number  
When the sun refuse to shine

3. And when the moon turns red with blood  
And when the moon turns red with blood  
Lord I want to be in that number  
When the moon turns red with blood  


{:start="4"}  
4. O when the trumpet sounds its call  
O when the trumpet sounds its call  
Lord I want to be in that number  
When the trumpet sounds its call

Is the only one we need  
But I'm waiting for that morning  
When the new world is revealed

6. Oh, when the new world is revealed  
Oh, when the new world is revealed  
Lord I want to be in that number  
When the new world is revealed
