1. When Johnny comes marching home again,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
We'll give him a hearty welcome then,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
The men will cheer, the boys will shout,  
The ladies they will all turn out,  
And we'll all feel gay  
When Johnny comes marching home.  


2. The old church bells will peal with joy,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
To welcome home our darling boy,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
The village lads and lassies say  
With roses they will strew the way,  
And we'll all feel gay  
When Johnny comes marching home.  


3. Get ready for the Jubilee,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
We'll give the hero three times three,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
The laurel wreath is ready now  
To place upon his loyal brow,  
And we'll all feel gay  
When Johnny comes marching home.  


4. Let love and friendship on that day,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
Their choicest treasures then display,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
And let each one perform some part  
To fill with joy the warrior's heart,  
And we'll all feel gay  
When Johnny comes marching home.
