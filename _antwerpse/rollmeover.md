{:start="0"}  
0. We've tried it once or twice  
And we found it rather nice  

- Roll me over, lay me down and do it again  
Roll me over, in the clover,  
Roll me over, lay me down and do it again  

{:start="1"}  
1. Oh, this is number one  
And the fun has just begun  

{:start="2"}  
2. Oh, this is number two  
And he's got me in a stew  

{:start="3"}  
3. Oh, this is number three  
And his hand is on my knee  

{:start="4"}  
4. Oh, this is number four  
And he's got me on the floor  

{:start="5"}  
5. Oh, this is number five  
And his hand is on my thigh  

{:start="6"}  
6. Oh, this is number six  
And he's got me doing tricks  

{:start="7"}  
7. Oh, this is number seven  
And he takes me straight to heaven  

{:start="8"}  
8. Oh, this is number eight  
And the doctor's at the gate  

{:start="9"}  
9. Oh, this is number nine  
And the twins are doing fine  

{:start="10"}  
10. Oh, this is number ten  
And he's started once again  

{:start="11"}  
11. Oh, this is number eleven  
And it's just like number seven
