0. We've tried it once or twice  
And we found it rather nice  

- Roll me over, lay me down and do it again  
Roll me over, in the clover,  
Roll me over, lay me down and do it again  

1. Oh, this is number one  
And the fun has just begun  

2. Oh, this is number two  
And he's got me in a stew  

3. Oh, this is number three  
And his hand is on my knee  

4. Oh, this is number four  
And he's got me on the floor  

5. Oh, this is number five  
And his hand is on my thigh  

6. Oh, this is number six  
And he's got me doing tricks  

7. Oh, this is number seven  
And he takes me straight to heaven  

8. Oh, this is number eight  
And the doctor's at the gate  

9. Oh, this is number nine  
And the twins are doing fine  

10. Oh, this is number ten  
And he's started once again  

11. Oh, this is number eleven  
And it's just like number seven
