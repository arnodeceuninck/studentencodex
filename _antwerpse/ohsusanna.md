1.  I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee
I'm goin' to Louisiana, my true love for to see
It rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot I froze to death
Susanna don't you cry


- Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me
Cos' I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee


2. I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
A-coming down the hill
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth,
The tear was in her eye,
I said I'm coning from the south,
Susanna don't you cry


3. I soon will be in New Orleans
And then I'll look around
And when I find Susanna
I will fall upon the ground
And if I do not find her
This man will surely die
And when I'm dead and buried
Susanna don't you cry
