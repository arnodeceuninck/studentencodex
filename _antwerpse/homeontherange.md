1.  Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam,  
Where the deer and the antelope play,  
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word  
And the skies are not cloudy all day.  


- Home, home on the range,  
Where the deer and the antelope play;  
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word  
And the skies are not cloudy all day.  


{:start="2"}  
2. Where the air is so pure, the zephyrs so free,  
The breezes so balmy and light,  
That I would not exchange my home on the range  
For all of the cities so bright.  


{:start="3"}  
3. The red man was pressed from this part of the West,  
He's likely no more to return  
To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever  
Their flickering camp-fires burn.  


{:start="4"}  
4. How often at night when the heavens are bright  
With the light from the glittering stars,  
Have I stood here amazed and asked as I gazed  
If their glory exceeds that of ours.  


{:start="5"}  
5. Oh, I love these wild prairies where I roam,  
The curlew I love to hear scream,  
And I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks  
That graze on the mountain-tops green.  


{:start="6"}  
6. Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand  
Flows leisurely down the stream;  
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along  
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.
