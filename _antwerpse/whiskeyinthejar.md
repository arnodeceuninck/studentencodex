1.  As I was going over the far famed Kerry mountains,
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was count'n.
I first produced me pistol, and then produced me rapier,
Saying stand and deliver for you are the bold deceiver.


- Musha rig um du rum da
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar


2. He counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to darling Jenny.
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceave me,
But the devil take the women for they always lie so easy.


3. I went into me chamber all for to take a slumber
To dream of gold and jewels and of course it was no wonder,
Me Jenny took me charges and she filled them up with water,
And sent for Captain Farrel, to get ready for the slaughter.


4. 'Twas early in the morning before I rose to travel,
There came a band of footmen and likewise Captain Farrell;
I goes to draw me pistol, for she'd stole away my rapier
But I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.


5. Well, they put me into jail 
with a judge all a writin'
For robbing captain Farrell 
on the Kerry Mountain.
But they didn't take me fists 
Wo I knocked the jailer down,
And bid a farewell to 
to his tight fisted town.


6. I'd like to find me brother 
the one that's in the army,
I don't know where he's stationed 
in Cork or in Killarney.
Together we'd go roving
o'r the mountains of Kilkenney,
And I swear he'd treat me better 
than me darling' sporting Jenny.


7. There's some takes delight 
in the carriages and rolling,
Some takes delight 
in the hurley or the bowlin'.
But I takes delight in 
the juice of the barley,
Courting pretty maids in 
the morning oh so early.
