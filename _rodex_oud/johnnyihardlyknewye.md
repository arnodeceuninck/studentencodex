While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo  
While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo  
While goin' the road to sweet Athy  
A stick in me hand and a drop in me eye  
A doleful damsel I heard cry,  
Johnny I hardly knew ye.  

_With your drums and guns and guns and drums, hurroo, hurroo  
With your drums and guns and guns and drums, hurroo, hurroo  
With your drums and guns and guns and drums  
The enemy nearly slew ye  
Oh my darling dear, Ye look so queer  
Johnny I hardly knew ye._  

Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo  
Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo  
Where are the eyes that looked so mild  
When my heart you so beguiled  
Why did ye scadaddle from me and the child   
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.  

Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo  
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo  
Where are your legs that used to run,  
When you went to carry a gun  
Indeed your dancing days are done  
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.  

I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo  
I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo  
I'm happy for to see ye home  
All from the island of Sulloon  
So low in the flesh, so high in the bone  
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.  

Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo  
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo  
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg  
Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg  
Ye'll have to be put with a bowl out to beg  
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.  

They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo  
They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo  
They're rolling out the guns again  
But they'll never will take my sons again  
No they'll never will take my sons again  
Johnn I'm swearing to ye.
