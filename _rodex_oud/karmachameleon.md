* Culture Shock *  

There's a loving in your eyes all the way  
If I listen to your lies, would you say?  
I'm a man without conviction  
I'm a man who doesn't know  
How to sell a contradiction  
You come and go  
You come and go  

Refrein:  
Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon  
You come and go  
You come and go  
Loving would be easy  
If your colours were like my dreams  
Red, gold and green  
Red, gold and green  

Didn't hear your wicked  
Words every day  
And you used to be so sweet  
I heard you say  
That my love was an addiction  
When we cling our love is strong  
When you go you're gone forever  
You string along  
You string along  

Every day is like survival  
You're my lover not my rival  
Everyday is like survival  
You're my lover not my rival  
I'm a man without conviction  
I'm a man who doesn't know  
How to sell a contradiction  
You come and go  
You come and go  

Refrein
