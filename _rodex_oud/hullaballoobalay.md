Me father kept a boardinghouse,  
Hullabaloo balay! Hullabaloo balay!  
Me father kept a boardinghouse,  
Hullabaloo balay.  

The boardinghouse was on the quay,  
Hullabaloo.. .  
Hullabaloo.. .  
Hullabaloo.. .  
Hullabaloo.. .  
Hullabaloo.. .  
Hullabaloo.. .  


But the loggers were nearly all at sea...  

A flash young fellow called John Brown...  

He followed me father all round the town...  

Me father said: "Young man, me boy!"  

To which he qyuckly made reply ...
