* Mario Lanza *  

Ein zwei drei vier  
Lift your stein and drink your beer  
Ein zwei drei vier  
Lift your stein and drink your beer  

Drink! Drink! Drink!  
To eyes that are bright as stars when they're shining on me!  
Drink! Drink! Drink!  
To lips that are red and sweet as the fruit on the tree!  

Here's a hope that those bright eyes will shine  
Lovingly, longingly soon into mine!  
May those lips that are red and sweet,  
Tonight with joy my own lips meet!  

Drink! Drink!  
Let the toast start!  
May young hearts never part!  
Drink! Drink! Drink!  
Let every true lover salute his sweetheart!  

Drink! Drink! Drink!   
To arms that are white and warm as a rose in the sun!  
Drink! Drink! Drink!  
To hearts that will love one, only when I am the one!  
Here's a hope that those soft arms will thine  
Tenderly, trustingly soon around mine!  

All I ask is the right to see the smiling eyes beguiling me  
Drink! Drink!  
Let the toast start! May young hearts never part!  

Drink! Drink! Drink!  
To eyes that are bright as stars when they're shingin on me!  
Drink! Drink! Drink!  
To lips that are red and sweet as the fruit on the tree!  
Here's hope that those soft arms will twine  
Tenderly, trustingly soon around mine!  

All I ask is a right to see the smiling eyes beguiling me  
Drink! Drink!  
Let the toast start!  
May young hearts never part!  
Drink! Drink! Drink!  
Let every true lover salute it's sweetheart!  
Let's drink!
