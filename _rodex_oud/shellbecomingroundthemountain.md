* melodie: Ik heb een tante in Marokko *  

She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes,  
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes,  
She'll be steaming and a puffing,  
Oh Lord! She won't stop for nothing.  
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes.  

She'll be driving six white horses when she comes,  
She'll be driving six white horses when she comes,  
She'll be driving six white horses,   
She'll be driving six white horses.  
She'll be driving six white horses when she comes.  

Oh, we'll all go out to meet her when she comes,  
Oh, we'll all go out to meet her when she comes,  
We will kill the old red rooster,  
We will kill the old red rooster.  
And we'll have chicken dumplings when she comes.  

She'll be wearing red pyjamas when she comes,  
She'll be wearing red pyjamas when she comes,  
She'll be wearing red pyjamas,  
She'll be wearing red pyjamas.   
She'll be wearing red pyjamas when she comes.  

She will have to sleep with Grandma when she comes,  
She will have to sleep with Grandma when she comes,  
She will have to sleep with Grandma,   
She will have to sleep with Grandma.   
She will have to sleep with Grandma when she comes.
