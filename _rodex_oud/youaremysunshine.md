You are my sunshine,  
my only sunshine,  
you make me happy when skies are gray.  
You'll never know dear,  
how much I love you,  
please don't take my sunshine away.  

The other night, dear,  
as I was sleeping,  
I dreamed I held you in my arms.  
but when I woke up,  
I was mistaken.  
so I laid my head and I cried.
