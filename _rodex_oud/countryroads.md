* John Denver *  

Almost heaven, West Virginia,  
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.  
Life is old there, older than the trees,  
younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.  

Refrein:  
Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong.  
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads.  

All my memories gather round her,  
miner's lady, stranger to blue water.  
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,  
misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.  

Refrein  

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me,  
the radio reminds me of my home far away.  
And driving down the road I get a feeling  
that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.  

Refrein (x2)  

Take me home now, country roads.  
Take me home now, country roads.
