On a wagon bound for market,  
lies a calf with a mournful eye.  
High above him there's a swallow,  
winging swiftly through the sky.  

How the winds are laughing,  
they laugh with all their might,  
Laugh and laugh the whole day through  
and half the summer's night.  
Donna donna donna, donna)  
Donna donna donnam don	) (bis)  

Stop complaining said the farmer,  
who told you it had to be.  
Wy can't you have wings to fly with,  
like the swallow so proud and free.  

Calves are easily bound and slaughtered,  
never knowing the reason why.  
But whoever treasures freedom,  
like the swallow has learned to fly.
