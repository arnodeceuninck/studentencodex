As I was going over the far famed Kerry Mountains  
I met with Captain Farrel and his money he was counting   
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier  
Said "stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver"  

Musharing doodum da, doodum da, wack fol the daddy-o  
Wack fol the daddy-o, there's whisky in the jar  

I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny  
I put it in my pocket, and I then took it home to Jenny  
She sighted and she swore that she never would deceive me  
But the devil take the women, for they never can be easy  

I went unto my chamber, all for to take a slumber  
I dreamt of gold and jewels, and for sure it was no wonder  
That Jenny drew my charges and she filled them up with water  
Then she sent for Captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter  

It was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel  
Up comes a band of footmen, and likewise Captain Farrel  
I first produced my pistol, for she'd stolen away my rapier  
But I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken  

If I could find my brother who listed in the army  
I know that he would aid me in Cork or in Killarney  
We'd set out for Kilkenny, and no one dare to follow  
And I'd be much safer with him than with my faithless Jenny  

Some take delight in fishin', some take delight in bowlin'  
Some like the fields, or the sea that goes a-rollin'  
But I take more delight now in the juice of the Barley  
Then to courtin' pretty maidens in the mornin' bright and early.
