* The dubliners *  

I danced in the morning when the world was young  
I danced in the moon, and the stars, and the sun  
I came down from Heaven and I danced on the Earth  
At Bethlehem I had my birth.  

Dance, dance, wherever you may be  
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he  
And I;ll lead you all, wherever you may be  
And I'll lead you all in the dance, said He  

I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee.  
If they would not dance, they would not follow me.  
So I danced for the fisherman, James and John  
They came with me, so the dance went on.  

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame  
They holy people said it was a shame.  
So they whipped, they stripped, they hung me high.  
They left me there on the cross to die.  

I danced on a Friday, when the sky turned black  
Its hard to dance with the Devil on your back  
They buried my body, they thought I was gone.  
But I am the dance and the dance goes on.  

They cut me down, but I leapt on high.  
I am the light that will never, never die.  
But I'll live in you if you'll live in me.  
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he.
