* Tekst & muziek : Zjuul Krapuul *  

Sometimes it's fine, in the pissijn,  
I have some fun, with die van mijn,  
It's getting out, that's very stout 	)  
And I am screaming, loud and proud	) (bis)  

I'm a Robert,  
I'm coming kleer,  
I'm coming kleer, everywhere  

With my own hand, it is plezant,  
Cos it may run, right out of hand,  
My arms are strong, my bird is long,  
And there is a shootplek, on 't plafon.  

And from my youth, I know the truth,  
And all the secrets, of my flute,  
I know, it's right, to hold him tight,  
And play him off, from tijd to tijd.
