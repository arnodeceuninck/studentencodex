From this valley they say you are going  
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile  
For they say, you are taking the sunshine  
That brightens our pathway the while.  

Come and sit by my side if you love me  
Do not hasten to bid me adieu  
But remember the Red River Valley  
And the one that has loved you so true.  

Won't you think of the valley you're leaving  
Oh, how lonely, how sad it will be  
Oh, think of the fnd heart you're breaking  
And the grief you are causing to see.  

As you go to your home by the ocean  
May you never forget those sweet hours  
That we spent in the Red River Valley  
And the love we exchanged mid the flowers.
