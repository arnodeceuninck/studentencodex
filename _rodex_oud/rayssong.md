* Uit de volksmond opgetekend door Mon Myklebust *  

And this is number 1 and the fun has just begun.  

I like the feeling,  
Roll me over, in the clover,  
Roll me over, lay me down,  
And do it again.  

And this is number 2 and my hand is on her shoe.  

And this is number 3 and my hand is on her knee.  

And this is number 4 and we layed down on the floor.  

And this is number 5 and she said she liked my drive.  

And this is number 6 and she said she liked my tricks.  

And this is number 7 and she said she was in heaven.  

And this is number 8 and the baby couldn't wait.  

And this is number 9 and the baby wasn't mine.  

And this is number 10 and I got lipstick on my pen.
